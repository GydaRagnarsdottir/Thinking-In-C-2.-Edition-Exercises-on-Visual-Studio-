1.Theory:
Overloading:
distinguish different functions of the same name with arguments and/or return type.

Union:
Unlike class, union has public as default accessability of members, the same as struct.Neither can union become the base class of inheritance.
However union can also have constructor, destructor and member function.
If the anonymous union is at file scope (outside all functions and classes) then it must be declared static so it has internal linkage.

Default arguments:
function(int a=0);
Only trailing arguments may be defaulted

Placeholder arguments:
Arguments without identifier in a function declaration.
Could be removed without generating warning.
To surpress warning info about unused variable.

Comparison betwenn Default Argument and Overloading:
The most important consideration is the design of class interface
When creating an object is a heavy load, overloading is preferable.

2.Practice
Always initialize data members before calling function.
Mem::Mem(int sz) {                      Mem::Mem(int sz) {
  if (sz != 0)                            mem = 0;
		ensureMinSize(sz);    ==>(X)          size = 0;           ==>(O)
	mem = 0;                                if (sz != 0)  
	size = 0;                                 ensureMinSize(sz);                 
}                                       }


3.Open Questions:
(1)."Stash::Stash(int sz, int initQuantity) : storage(new Mem(sz * initQuantity)) {"
What is this statement format?
A:Constructor Initializer List, see Chapter 8.
(2).
typedef unsigned char byte;
...
int Stash::add(void* element) {
	if (next >= quantity) // Enough space left?
		inflate(increment);
	int startBytes = next * size;
	byte* e = (byte*)element;
	memcpy(mem->pointer()[startBytes], e, sizeof(e));
	next++;
	return(next - 1); // Index number
}
Reported "unmatched type" in memcpy statement, both are of type byte, why?
